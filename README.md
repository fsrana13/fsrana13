I obtained my PhD in Cognitive Science of Language from McMaster University in 2022. I am a language and speech scientist who enjoys solving problems and wants to use her powers for good. Both the science and art of language intrigue me, and I find creative joy in both. People who have worked with me would describe me as curious, critical, and detail-oriented--aspects I consider integral to who I am as a researcher. 

I am interested in applying my expertise to make language accessible in the widespread technology we use every day. My research focused on understanding the role of unpredictable timing variations in speech perception. I used multi-modal research designs incorporating behavioural and EEG techniques to analyse corroborative data and form conclusions. In this repository, you will find experiment protocols, stimuli designs and tokens, as well as sample scripts that I used to run my analyses.

I'm currently learning more about NLP techniques and their applications, and hoping to add related projects soon.

If you work with language and tech and are passionate about communication, let's chat! You can find me on LinkedIn (@fareehasrana).
